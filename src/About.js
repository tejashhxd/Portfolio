        Hi, I’m Tejash Kumar, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science
        Engineering (AI/ML) at Salt Lake, Sector V, Kolkata. I’m passionate
        about coding and love exploring new technologies, especially in the
        fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This portfolio
        marks just the beginning of my journey—I’m constantly learning,
        building, and adding new projects along the way. Stay tuned, because
        there’s a lot more to come!
